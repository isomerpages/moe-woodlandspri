### **Student Leadership**

#### **Overview**
Woodlands Primary School believes that every pupil has the potential to be developed as a leader. Thus, our Student Leadership Programme aims to develop in every Woodlander basic leadership skills to lead oneself first before he/she can graciously lead others.

##### **Our Approach**
In alignment with our school’s Vision to foster Gracious Woodlanders with the Zest to Excel, we have adopted Kouzes and Posner’s (2005) Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership as outcomes for our Student Leadership Programme. Through the programme, we aim to inculcate in our student leaders the following 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership:

*   To believe in yourself and have the confidence to&nbsp;**Model the Way**
*   To care for others and have the passion to&nbsp;**Encourage the Heart**
*   To show respect for others and foster collaboration that&nbsp;**Enable Others to Act**
*   To believe in and lead others to be able to&nbsp;**Inspire a Shared Vision**
*   To have courage and apply innovation to&nbsp;**Challenge the Process**

To develop leadership qualities in all our pupils, the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership and related skills are explicitly taught and inculcated in Woodlanders progressively over the 6 years through assembly talks, class-based leadership lessons and VIA programmes.

Our specially designed Student Leadership Core Programmes provide student leaders with opportunities to extend their learning and to apply their knowledge and skills they have been equipped with.
