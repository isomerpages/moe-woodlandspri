In Art Club, pupils are provided opportunities to develop a lifelong passion for Visual Art, as well as build their character. Pupils are nurtured to think and express themselves creatively through enjoyable and meaningful art making, building inquiry skills, exploring and experimenting with different media and materials. At the same time, teamwork allows pupils to strengthen their sense of belonging, commitment and responsibility to school, community and nation. Art exhibition and gallery visits are organised to enrich pupils’ learning beyond the classroom.&nbsp;

Through participating in the 2023 SYF Art Exhibition (‘Artist and Inspiration’) projects, pupils shared their creative inquiries and responses that are inspired by their encounter with famous artworks. 3 categories of artwork were submitted – Chinese Painting by the Primary 2 group, Recycled Sculpture Art by the Primary 3 and 4 group and Augmented Reality Art by the Primary 5 and 6 group.


#### **Chinese Cultural Club**
In Chinese Cultural Club, a variety of activities are designed to educate our pupils to appreciate Chinese Culture. Pupils are introduced to Chinese cultural arts and crafts such as Chinese paper cutting, paper carving, tea appreciation, Chinese knot making, bean art, Chinese painting, mask painting, paper origami and many more.

#### **Information and Communications Club**
Information and Communications (Info-Comm) Club at Woodlands Primary School, aims to inspire our pupils who are keen on learning ICT skills. It is an exciting 3-years program of introducing various digital media technology such as basic programming to create games as well as photography and videography using DSLR cameras. These learning experiences go beyond their pen and paper in the formal curriculum. Under the guidance of experienced trainers and teachers, pupils are equipped with relevant Info-Comm skills to expand their creativity by using different computer software.

#### **Robotics Club**
The Robotics Club provides opportunities for pupils who are interested in constructing and programming to pursue their passion beyond the requirements of the Primary School Science syllabus. The trainings that they undergo hone their creativity and thinking skills. Pupils are given opportunities to create and program a robot all by themselves which instils the ‘entrepreneurial dare’ in them. While the pupils are pursuing their passion, they derive joy from it and this CCA truly achieves the objective of “Joy of Learning”

#### **Speech and Drama Club**
The main objective of the Speech and Drama Club is to help our pupils explore ways of expressing themselves using the appropriate voice. Techniques like tableau, mimes, speech drills and improvisation are taught to our pupils. They were also introduced to the 4Ps of voice – pitch, pace, pause and power through prose, sentences and poems. The training in speech has helped our pupils to improve their confidence and self- esteem when communicating with others. They are better able to express themselves using the techniques learnt. The highlight for our training can be observed from the year end performance during Children’s Day.
