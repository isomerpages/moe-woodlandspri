### **Uniformed Group**
#### **Scouts**
The Manta Ray Scouts group encompasses both the Cub Scouts and the Scouts group. We have moved from strength to strength ever since its inauguration in 2006. In 2012, as a natural progression from the Scout Unit, we paved our steps to include another wing – the Manta Ray Venture Unit.

The Group places emphasis on developing every individual as a unique self with ample opportunities in leadership. We run the progress and proficiency badge system for all three levels of Scouting and prepare the group to take on the challenge of attaining the highest award in each level of Scouting – the Akela Award for the Cub Scouts, the Chief Commissioner’s Award for the Scouts and the President Scout Award for the Venture Scouts.

The Cub Scouts and Scouts sections have been achieving the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award since 2003 and 2010 respectively.

We traditionally commence the year with a Founders’ Day celebration where we initiate new cubs into the group. Throughout the year, we will also have many other exciting activities such as camps and overseas learning journeys.
