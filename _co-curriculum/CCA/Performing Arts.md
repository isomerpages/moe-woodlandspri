### **Performing Arts**

#### **Choir**

Priding ourselves as an established and fine choir with an excellent track record, the Woodlands Primary School Choir has the hard work and dedication put in by the choristers, teachers, and instructors through the decades to thank for. We frequently celebrate the achievements and successes of our choristers, who are between the ages of 8 to 12.&nbsp;

  

In Woodlands Primary, we envision every chorister to be a confident and gracious singer, who possesses the discipline and zest to achieve excellence in his or her musical pursuit. We hope to develop in all our choristers the skills and knowledge for continuous learning, so they will continue to enjoy musical and artistic pursuits in the future.

Established in 2002 with the aim of cultivating the interest and igniting the passion for music, the Handbell Ensemble provides the platform for all students who show a keen interest to come together in music making. We welcome all students to join the ensemble so long as they have the interest and possess the correct attitude and aptitude.

Our ringers can look forward to playing a repertoire of music of different genres and styles and ringing different notes with different handbells and handchimes for different music pieces. During the weekly CCA sessions, ringers are assigned to play specific notes in a music piece. As part of the training, they learn note reading, music notation as well as handbell ringing techniques and are taught how to effectively control and phrase the dynamics so that they can play a given piece of music beautifully. Everyone has a vital role to play and contributes significantly to the success of music making in the ensemble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Being a member of the schoolâ€™s Handbell Ensemble provides our ringers invaluable opportunities to attend masterclasses, learning journeys and exchange programmes as well as take part in the biennial SYF Arts Performance. There are also opportunities for them to perform at various school events, community events and national events. Through their participation in these activities and performances, we hope to develop our students to become confident and joyful musicians.

#### **Chinese Dance**
Woodlands Primary Chinese Dance aims to instil in pupils their passion for dance and to develop in them a love for the aesthetics. Not only will pupils learn the traditional Chinese dance steps, they will also be exposed to different genres of dances like contemporary and hip hop. Through participating in various competitions and performances, pupils learn to work as a team and gain self- confidence.

The Malay dance group aspires to instil self confidence and teamwork through the learning of culture. Through their participation, we hope that the dancers will not only learn to express their feelings and appreciate others but also to understand the importance of dedication and commitment values which are important to the holistic development of the dancer. The dancers develop their non-academic talent by learning both traditional as well as contemporary Malay dance techniques taught by a qualified and very committed dance instructor employed by the school. The Malay dance group participates actively in various school and community celebrations.

Our Indian Dancers at Woodlands Primary School have made significant progress over the years. The troupe has performed at both school and community events. The dancers are trained by a very experienced dance choreographer, Madam Parvathy, who has about 25 years of experience in teaching Indian Dance. Our dancers are exposed to both classical and semi-classical dance techniques.
