### **Performing Arts**

#### **Choir**
Priding ourselves as an established and fine choir with an excellent track record of achievements, we have the hard work and dedication put in by the choristers, teachers and instructor through the decade to thank for. We have grown from a fledgling choir to the schoolâ€™s niche CCA under the Performance And Character Education (PACE) through Choir initiative. Anchoring on our strong belief in developing our choristers holistically, we have developed our choral programme into two broad areas, mainly, choral singing skills and character development. We are actively engaged in continual renewal, seeking improvement to meet new challenges as we take our choir to new heights.

The Handbells and Handchimes Ensemble was established in 2002 and has since clinched 5 sliver awards.

Members of the ensemble consist of mainly Primary 4, Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils.

Recruitment of new members begins in Primary 3 after the P3 Singing Bells and Choirchimes curriculum-based music enrichment lessons. Pupils who have been identified as having an aptitude and attitude will be invited to join the CCA. Further auditions will be conducted to confirm the final list of members recruited into the CCA.

#### **Chinese Dance**
Woodlands Primary Chinese Dance aims to instil in pupils their passion for dance and to develop in them a love for the aesthetics. Not only will pupils learn the traditional Chinese dance steps, they will also be exposed to different genres of dances like contemporary and hip hop. Through participating in various competitions and performances, pupils learn to work as a team and gain self- confidence.

The Malay dance group aspires to instil self confidence and teamwork through the learning of culture. Through their participation, we hope that the dancers will not only learn to express their feelings and appreciate others but also to understand the importance of dedication and commitment values which are important to the holistic development of the dancer. The dancers develop their non-academic talent by learning both traditional as well as contemporary Malay dance techniques taught by a qualified and very committed dance instructor employed by the school. The Malay dance group participates actively in various school and community celebrations.

Our Indian Dancers at Woodlands Primary School have made significant progress over the years. The troupe has performed at both school and community events. The dancers are trained by a very experienced dance choreographer, Madam Parvathy, who has about 25 years of experience in teaching Indian Dance. Our dancers are exposed to both classical and semi-classical dance techniques.
