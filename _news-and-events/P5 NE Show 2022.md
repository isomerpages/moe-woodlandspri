The pupils were fascinated as various elements of the parade made their appearances with the theme “Stronger Together, Majulah!” These included aerobatic displays by F-16 fighter jets, landings by the Red Lions parachutists, security operations demonstration by the Singapore Armed Forces and the Total Defence Display by the Home Team.

The most awaited part of the parade was the dazzling display of fireworks. Pupils were in awe as the fireworks dotted the sky.
