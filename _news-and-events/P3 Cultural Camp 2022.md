### **P3 Cultural Camp 2022**
In the last week of June holidays, our Primary 3 pupils attended a day camp to increase their exposure to different Mother Tongue cultures.

They learnt traditional art forms, such as mask painting, Wayang Kulit and Indian Kolam. Pupils also played some traditional games and learnt basic Wushu and Silat moves.

The cultural camp sparked joy in their learning and the appreciation of the different cultures. Our pupils went home with big smiles on their faces and beautiful art pieces in their hands.
