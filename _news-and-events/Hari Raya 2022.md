### **Hari Raya 2022**
The theme for this year's Hari Raya Puasa celebration was "Give! Smile! & Celebrate Eid". Woodlanders had the opportunity to volunteer and donate from a young age during the Food from the Heart donation drive.

With the invaluable help of the PSG, our Prefects set up booths during recess to encourage all Woodlanders to pen down their Hari Raya well wishes for pupils from Woodlands Gardens School. In collaboration with the Malay Heritage Centre, a pop-up exhibition was also set up, showcasing Ramadan and Hari Raya through fun and interactive displays.

The highlight of the festivities was the long-anticipated Hari Raya concert in the hall, which Woodlanders enjoyed whole-heartedly. They cheered loudly as they were treated to beautiful dance performances, interesting vlogs and even a fashion show!
