### **P4 Leadership Fiesta 2022**
On 20 June 2022, our Primary 4 pupils reported to school excitedly for their Leadership Fiesta. After some ice-breaker activities, they were introduced to the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership (Kouzes and Posner, 2005).

With a focus on Encourage the Heart and Challenge the Process, pupils went through a series of activities to help them understand and demonstrate those practices. They were also placed into mixed groupings so they could learn to work together with their peers from other classes.

They also had an opportunity to put into practice what they had learnt, and experience the natural outdoor environment with an Amazing Race at Sentosa that afternoon. It was a fun-filled day for our Primary 4 pupils learning about leadership.
