### **P5 Camp 2021**
The annual P5 camp is the highlight of every Primary 5 Woodlanders. 

This year, our pupils experienced a unique P5 camp that was organised in-house by our own teachers. They were engaged in various activities around the school such as tent pitching, nagivation and an obstacle course!

Through these activities, they learnt C.A.R.E.: to collaborate, be adaptable and resilient, and most importantly, to have empathy for others.

Check out some snippets of our P5s in actions!
