### **Games Day 2021**
Our Upper Primary pupils look forward to the annual Games Day held towards the end of the year.

With safe management measures in place, Games Day took a different approach this year. While the usual inter-class matches could not be carried out, our pupils had fun pitting their skills against one another with their quick reactions to the games played on the iPads.

Pupils demonstrated resilience, adaptability and collaboration as they participated and contributed valuable game points for their classes.
