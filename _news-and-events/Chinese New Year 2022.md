### **Chinese New Year 2022**

Woodlands Primary welcomes the Year of the Tiger. Over the past few weeks, our pupils decorated their classrooms as part of our annual classroom decoration contest.

With the help of our Parent Support Group (PSG), our school campus was beautifully adorned with festive decorations. They also assisted in facilitating the recess activities where our pupils handmade greeting cards.

Our pupils came to school dressed in their beautiful ethnic costumes. They enjoyed themselves watching the Lunar New Year concert and were thrilled to see our very own God of Fortune, lion dancers and dragon dancers! They had fun creating crafts with their classmates in the later part of the celebration.
