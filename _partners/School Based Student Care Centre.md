<p>Established in 2006, NASCANS is currently one of the largest student care
operators in Singapore with over 30 centres islandwide. Our mission is
to help children develop positive, healthy thinking habits and leadership
skills, and to build strength of character through fun learning activities.
We work closely with the school and parents to provide homework supervision,
quality enrichment and character development programmes to help develop
students holistically in the after-school hours.</p>
