### **Student Learning Space (SLS)**
The [SLS](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login) is an online learning portal providing equal access to quality curriculum-aligned resources in major subjects from primary to pre-university level, in line with the development of [21st Century Competencies (21CC)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies).

The SLS also provides teachers with a range of tools to customise and create meaningful learning experiences that cater to diverse learning needs. For example, teachers have access to tools that help to make students’ thinking processes visible. This enables teachers to make informed decisions and provide targeted intervention to address any gaps in understanding.

The SLS also serves as a common online platform for teachers to apply, adapt and share new pedagogies by facilitating collaborations across classrooms and schools.

The SLS is continually being developed in response to the needs of students and teachers. Curriculum-aligned resources and system tools are continually being improved and developed in line with suggestions and feedback from teachers and students to cater to students’ diverse and evolving learning needs.
