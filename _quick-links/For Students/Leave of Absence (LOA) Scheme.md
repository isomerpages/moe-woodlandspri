### **Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme**
The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after their return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a register student of the school. They can be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

LOA applies to all SC and PR children in primary school, secondary school, junior colleges, and Millennia Institute.

You may refer to MOE website **[here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/returning-singaporeans)** for more information on the eligibility and fees.
