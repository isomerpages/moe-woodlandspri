<p><strong><em>SPACE</em></strong>&nbsp;is a whole school approach to character
building through sports. This is anchored in the beliefs that developing
a passion for sports is an important component in the holistic development
of pupils, and that sportsmen need to possess sound values and character.
Through a 3E approach, various sports module are implemented for all pupils</p>

<h5><strong>Pervasiveness of Programme<br><u>SPACE (Experience): Most Valued Pupil (MVP)</u></strong></h5>
<p>The MVP programme emphasises the deliberate integration of affective learning
within the PE, Art, and Music curriculum. It cultivates and reinforces
students shared values and strengthens character development initiatives.
Students are actively encouraged to embody both the school's core values
and R3ICH values across all aspects of the curriculum. Each term, PE teachers
present MVP awards to students who consistently exhibit positive behaviour
and exemplify these values in their daily conduct. This recognition serves
a dual purpose: celebrating and encouraging individual students whilst
highlighting exemplary role models for their peers to follow, ultimately
fostering a nurturing and values-centred school environment.</p>

<p><strong>P1: Lower Pri Games Carnival<br></strong>Objective of programme:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pursue learning with self-directedness and character building through
sports and games.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This programme enables students to take ownership of their learning and
develop character through sports and games. Students will approach multiple
games stations which would test their sports skills and strengthen their
values (eg: integrity – following rules; resilience – keep trying). Through
these experiences, students learn essential character traits by making
independent decisions rather than following instructions. This approach
allows sports to be a platform where students cultivate both physical skills
and moral values.</p>
