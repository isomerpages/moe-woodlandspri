### **English Language**
#### **Curriculum Framework:**
In 2020, a new English Language (EL) Syllabus was introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE). The EL Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.

The curriculum framework is shown below:

#### **Learning Experiences:**
*   **Lower Primary Learning Experiences (Readersâ€™ Theatre, Library Lessons and Fun Fridays)**<br>
Our P1 and P2 pupils develop their self-confidence and presentation skills through the platform of Readers' Theatre, using their voice, gestures and facial expressions to communicate the complexities of the plot and characters in the text which they read aloud as a class.
