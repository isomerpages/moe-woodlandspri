### **Science**
#### **Vision & Mission:**
##### **Vision:**
To enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate.

##### **Mission:**
We are committed to nurture every child to inquire, innovate and inspire others to learn and apply scientific concepts and skills to understand the world around them.

#### **Department Overview:**
The aims of the Science curriculum is to build pupils’ interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves as well their environment. In Woodlands Primary School, our teachers not only teach pupils to acquire the basic scientific concepts to understand the world around them, but also help the pupils to develop the skills, dispositions and attitudes for Science inquiry. More importantly, we want our pupils to apply the science concepts and skills in making responsible decisions and appreciate how Science influences people and the environment.

To achieve the desired outcome of pupils as inquirers, the myriads of Science programmes in Woodlands Primary School are designed to expose our pupils to opportunities to enhance and enrich their inquiry learning experiences.

#### **Core Programmes 2021:**
##### **Lower Primary Science**
The learning of Science in Woodlands Primary School begins as early as when the pupils are in Primary 1. The English and Science departments collaborate to infuse the teaching of Science concepts through the English curriculum. Learning becomes more holistic for the pupils.

##### **Science Class Library**
To encourage our pupils to read more widely, every class has a collection of Science magazines and books added to their class library. As a results, our pupils have become more curious about the environment they live in and is inspired to find out more.

##### **Hydroponics**
Hydroponics is a method of farming in which plants are grown in water that contains nutrients without the use of soil.

In Woodlands Primary School, hydroponics is incorporated into our Primary 3 Science syllabus, giving the pupils the opportunity to transplant the germinated seeds to the system, chart the growth of the vegetables, harvest the plants and sell them. By donating the proceeds of the sale to the identified charitable organization of the school, values-in-action is taking place.

This program has helped the pupils appreciate how technology is used in land- and water-scarce Singapore. Pupils can better appreciate what it means when Singapore moves towards “30 by 30” vision, whereby 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs will be produced locally by 2030.

##### **Excellence 2000 (Science) and Excel Science**
Excellence 2000 (Science) E2K and Excel Science are enrichment programmes that encourage our high-readiness pupils to think out of the box to carry out experiments like a scientist.

Besides designing experiments and testing hypothesis, the E2K pupils also have the opportunity to participate in the Sony Creative Science Award competition organized by the Science Centre. These experiences honed our pupils' skills where they learn to problem-solve, innovate and work collaboratively with others.

##### **Sci-sational@Recess**
Recess is the part of the school day where all pupils look forward to relax and play. Simple and short experiments are conducted during recess to provide pupils the opportunity to learn Science through play.

##### **Learning Journey (Virtual LJ in view of SMM for COVID-19)**
Learning journeys allow pupils’ learning to be extended beyond the classroom. Such real-life experiences help pupils relate concepts learnt to situations they observe in the surrounding. These are the key learning programmes for each level where learning of Science has been incorporated:<br>
