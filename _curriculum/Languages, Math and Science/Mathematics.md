### **Mathematics**
##### **Vision:**
Woodlanders driven by passion in Math.

##### **Mission:**
We are committed to develop motivated learners with strong Mathematical foundation to stay relevant.

#### **Department Overview:**
Our school adopts the MOE Mathematics Curriculum Framework and its Key Focus closely to develop Woodlanders with the necessary mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning.  We seek to develop confidence in Woodlanders and an appreciation of mathematics in their everyday life. Woodlanders are given the opportunities for different learning experiences such as hands-on activities and ICT to understand concepts. Woodlanders are provided with opportunities to be engaged in thinking, reasoning, communicating ideas and collaborating with one another during their learning process. Our school programmes are catered to develop the masses as well as targeted groups of pupils as part of Woodlandersâ€™ learning in WDP.

#### **Core Programmes:**

##### **Strategies and Support for All Pupils:**
1. Use of Various Teaching Approaches
 *   Our teachers explore and strengthen their skills in various teaching approaches in order to deliver the best lessons to our pupils. Some examples of the approaches our teachers have taken include the use of Play-based Learning and the use of ICT and e-Pedagogy. 
 * Through the various approaches taken, pupils have opportunities to be engaged in hands-on or virtual activities and games. 
*	With e-Pedagogy to guide our development of ICT-enhanced lessons, our teachers use tools and websites such as Student Learning Space (SLS), Google Classroom and web-based apps such as Blooket and Wordwall.
* Such experiences enable our pupils to enhance their learning as they learn new content, collaborate with one another and demonstrate their learning while having fun.

2. Use of Math Manipulatives
 *  Teaching and learning at all levels are supported with the use of Math manipulatives such as linking cubes and fraction discs.
*	We have also curated certain manipulatives and activities into a Math Kit for P1 and P2 pupils. The lower primary pupils use the Math Kit during lessons. They also get to bring them home during the holidays to play the games with their family in order to strengthen their Math concepts.

3. Use of In-House Worksheets and Materials
 *  Over the years, we have developed and continually improved our in-house worksheets to supplement the textbook and workbook. 
* These materials enable pupils to develop their:
* Factual fluency and mental math capabilities so that they can do math computation quickly and accurately. 
*	Skills in heuristics, such as looking for pattern, listing and model drawing, so that they can confidently solve higher order Math problems.
