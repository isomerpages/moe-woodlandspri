<h3><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong></h3>
<p>Woodlands Primary School has begun its PAL programme since 2013.</p>
<p>PAL is a major initiative recommended by the Primary Education Review
and Implementation (PERI) Committee which aims to address the need for
greater emphasis on non-academic programme for Primary 1 and 2 pupils.</p>
<h4><strong>Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>PAL offers pupils the platforms for experiential learning, experimentation,
exploration and achieving success as well as opportunities for learning
experiences to acquire a range of skills as well as interaction with their
peers.</p>
<p>Through PAL, we hope that Woodlands Primary School pupils will</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Exhibit confidence in what they do and express themselves effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exhibit curiosity and positive attitudes in learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy group experiences and develop teamwork</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, PAL will enhance the experiences of pupils in the moral, physical,
aesthetics, social and emotional domains of learning for a holistic education.</p>
<h4><strong>What</strong></h4>
<p>These modules are divided into two broad areas, Sports &amp; Games and
Outdoor Education, and Performing Arts and Visual Arts.</p>

<h4><strong>How</strong></h4>
<p>In a nutshell, all Primary 1 and 2 pupils will go through four different
modules of activities in a year. Each module consists of 7 lessons. During
each lesson, pupils will go through a series of experiential, creative
and fun activities which incorporates values education and social-emotional
learning. Through individual and group activities, pupils are able to learn
about themselves and understand how to better relate to and work with others,
which is an important competency to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised
world.</p>
<h4><strong>When</strong></h4>
<p>PAL lessons take place once a week within curriculum hours for two hours.</p>
<h4><strong>Sports &amp; Games</strong></h4>
<p>In this domain, pupils are actively engaged in a variety of physical activities
through team building and creative games. These physical activities aim
to illicit curiosity, creativity and confidence of each pupil. The pupils
learn team building skills in a group setting, to self-manage, relate with
their peers, and make responsible decisions for themselves and for the
team.</p>

<h4><strong>Outdoor Education</strong></h4>
<p>The aim of PAL Outdoor Education (OE) in Woodlands Primary School (WDP)
is to connect the pupils to their surroundings, by letting them observe
and appreciate the immediate environment around them.</p>
<p>The lessons covered will also allow them to learn the importance of collaborative
learning (through play) to achieve the stated Learning Outcomes (LOs).
This is done with the infusion of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
developmental milestones for the pupils, to further enhance their social
and emotional well-being for their initial years in WDP.</p>

<p><strong>P2 PAL Art – Green Artizens</strong>
</p>
<p>“Green Artizens” focuses on the exploration of art materials and media
through a greater awareness of our environment as responsible artists.
By learning about conservation of wildlife and using scrap materials around
us, pupils learn to give these art creations a new lease of life and learn
to appreciate the life forms that share Mother Nature together with us.
Fun and experiential in nature, the interactive activities provide platforms
for pupils to explore, create and share their feeling and thoughts in a
collaborative way with others.</p>

<h4><strong>Performing Art</strong></h4>
<p><strong>P1: Dramatize</strong>
</p>
<p>A series of drama lessons revolving around fairy tales, children’s books
and poems. Students will reflect, react, and rehearse the scripted dramatic
scenes. Using voice, gestures and dramatic movement, our P1 pupils will
investigate issues that happen in their everyday lives.</p>

<p><strong>P2: Around the World</strong>
</p>
<p>Water bottles, wooden sticks, trash-bins, tables and chairs. These are
just some of the items used by the P2 pupils for their STOMP Program. Don’t
underestimate these seemingly ordinary items. Watch as the pupils transform
them into a string of fun and upbeat music pieces. Don’t be surprised if
you catch your child at home, exploring and tapping different household
items to create interesting musical pieces.</p>
