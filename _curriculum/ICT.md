### **ICT**
#### **ICT Framework**
At Woodlands Primary, we adopt the 6-E approach to harness technology. All pupils in Woodlands Primary School go through ICT enhanced lessons that aim to enrich their learning. ICT modules are developed to equip pupils with basic ICT skills, enabling our pupils to use the knowledge and skills to create and develop innovative projects. In their learning, all pupils leverage on the Learning Management System (LMS) to supplement and enhance their learning. Teachers further develop interesting lessons employing technology to engage pupils in their lessons.
