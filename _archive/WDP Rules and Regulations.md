<p><strong>WOODLANDS PRIMARY SCHOOL DISCIPLINE APPROACH</strong>
</p>
<p>The school aims to promote positive behaviour and instill self-discipline
in students. Rules governing what constitutes appropriate behaviour are
established and enforced to maintain a safe and orderly environment conducive
for optimal learning. The school works in tandem with parents and other
stakeholders in developing students to be good role models and ambassadors
of the school. Students are encouraged to make informed decisions and act
responsibly towards self and others. All these in place would create a
positive environment enabling students to strive for excellence in all
their endeavours.</p>
<p>The school’s approach is based on the following beliefs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discipline is a learning process, and the goal is to teach students how
to develop self-discipline and good character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disciplinary measures help students understand that their actions carry
consequences, which helps them learn to take responsibility for their actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A whole-school, multi-faceted approach is adopted by working closely with
the different stakeholders in reinforcing positive behaviour in students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discipline will be complemented with counselling or restorative practices
where the school will partner the different stakeholders to ensure students
have learnt from their mistakes and work towards positively influencing
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
