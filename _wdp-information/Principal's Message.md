### **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/WhatsApp_Image_2024_02_27_at_1_56_28_PM.jpg" style="width:25%;margin-right:15px;" align="left"><b></b>**“Every student can learn, just not on the same day or in the same way.” – George Evans**

Indeed, here in Woodlands Primary School (WDP), we believe that every child wants to and can learn. Our vision is to nurture **Gracious Woodlanders with the Zest to Excel**. Our core values of Integrity, Collaboration, Adaptability, Respect, Resilience, Responsibility and Empathy (**iCAR<sup>3</sup>E**) form the bedrock that guides us in shaping quality learning experiences for our students. With our Vision and core values, we strive to create an environment where students are encouraged to explore, innovate, and grow to become better versions of themselves.

We are committed to using innovative pedagogies to foster an engaging and dynamic learning experience. One example is how the school leverages play-based learning, to encourage our young learners to explore concepts, test ideas and solve problems in a hands-on, immersive environment. We firmly believe that play has a profound impact on a child’s development, and this form of learning allows children to develop emerging 21CC such as adaptive and inventive thinking skills, while fostering creativity and curiosity. By integrating play with academic concepts, we create a rich learning environment where students not only master fundamental knowledge, but also develop the joy of learning, laying the foundation for lifelong success. 

At Woodlands Primary School, we are proud of our unique programmes that make learning both joyful and meaningful. Our Applied Learning Programme, Joy of Learning Languages (**JoL<sup>2</sup>**), aims to empower students to become confident communicators, while our Learning for Life Programme, Sports Performance and Character Education (**SPACE**) aims to build resilience, teamwork and character through sports. These programmes are designed to nurture well-rounded individuals who are anchored in good values, and excel both academically and in life skills. 

The school would not be able to bring about quality learning experiences for our students, without the unwavering and invaluable support from our stakeholders and community. We are deeply grateful for the partnership of our dedicated teachers, staff, school advisory committee, parents and community partners. I look forward to working alongside all of you, to bring out the best in each and every one of our Woodlanders!
