### **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/WhatsApp_Image_2024_02_27_at_1_56_28_PM.jpg" style="width:25%;margin-right:15px;" align="left"><b></b>**“Every student can learn, just not on the same day or in the same way.” – George Evans**

Indeed, here in Woodlands Primary School (WDP), we believe that every child wants to and can learn. This belief places our pupils at the heart of our educational decisions, which in turn guide the design and implementation of our school curriculum to cater to pupils’ diverse strengths, aspirations and needs.

Our school vision of pupils developing into “_Gracious Woodlanders with the Zest to Excel_” espouses a community of learners who demonstrates the mindset for excellence, pursues learning with self-directedness, and possesses social and emotional skills to navigate the future as well as act for the good of the society. Our six core values – Respect, Resilience, Passion, Adaptability, Collaboration and Innovation, underpin the school vision, and are embedded within the whole-school community.

The six primary school years are an important phase of a child’s education journey. During these formative years, we strive to focus on building every child’s confidence and desire to learn. Our holistic curriculum aims to provide pupils with a broad range of learning experiences that will help them to discover their talents and interests. For example, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Joy of Learning Languages (JOL2) enables us to develop 21st century competencies such as effective communication and critical thinking skills in our pupils, as we expose them to authentic learning experiences involving the English language and Mother Tongue languages. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Sports Performance And Character Education (SPACE) serves as a whole-school approach to character-building through sports. Through a 3E framework (Experience, Equip, Excel), various sports modules are designed and implemented for all pupils.

Of course, WDP could not have supported pupils with these provisions without the strong confidence, trust and support from our parents, the School Advisory Committee, as well as other important stakeholders in the community. I look forward to our continued close partnership to bring out the best in each and every one of our Woodlanders!
